#######################################
At the start of each script write this:
#######################################
// Project:         TwinstickChrisClayden
// Date created:	
// Date revised:	
// Original Author: 
// Contributors: <- only necessary once someone else bug fixes etc
// Notes: <- if you need to add anything else!

Before each class name write a short summary of what the script does
e.g.

// This script does nothing :D
public class Hello : Monobehaviour

##################
Naming conventions
##################
Start global variables with an underscore _
add type initial after that in lowercase:
Const variables should follow the above convention and but have the name in uppercase:
const int _iOURINT = 1;

Arrays should follow the following convention:

int[] _arr_i_spawnPoints; // where arr = array and i = type

Methods have capital letter at start

Keep public scope to a minimum with variables. Use protected if need be (if need to communicate with subclasses)
int _iANumber;

void Hi()
{
    double dMaMayne;
}

Quality of life

[Header] – Gives sections of your code titles
[Space] – Provides some spacing in the Inspector
[HideInInspector] – Hides section of code from Inspector
[SerializeField] – Allows private variables to become visible in the inspector
[Tooltip] – Provides a description of the variable in the Inspector
[Range(min,max)] – Allows you to state a min/max range on a variable
#region- Allows you to split code up into manageable chunks
#endregion - ends the region :D
